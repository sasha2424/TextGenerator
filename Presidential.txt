among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the 14th day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining yearsa retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellowcitizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated

such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellowcitizens at large less than either no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence

by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no separate views nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered perhaps as 'deeply' as 'finally' staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people

besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted

to the foregoing observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i was first honored with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require

having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favor the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally 'conspicuous' in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend

i am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its chief magistrate when the occasion proper for it shall arrive i shall endeavor to express the high sense i entertain of this distinguished honor and of the confidence which has been reposed in me by the people of united america

previous to the execution of any official act of the president the constitution requires an oath of office this oath i am now about to take and in your presence that if it shall be found during my administration of the government i have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof i may (besides incurring constitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn ceremony
the period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive government of the united states being not far distant and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust it appears to me proper especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice that i should now apprise you of the resolution i have formed to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made

i beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country and that in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my situation might imply i am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both

the acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference to what appeared to be your desire i constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power consistently with motives which i was not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which i had been reluctantly drawn the strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the idea i rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as internal no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my services that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire

the impressions with which i first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion in the discharge of this trust i will only say that i have with good intentions contributed toward the organization and administration of the government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications experience in my own eyes perhaps still more in the eyes of others has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary i have the consolation to believe that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene patriotism does not forbid it

in looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which i owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the opportunities i have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering though in usefulness unequal to my zeal if benefits have resulted to our country from these services let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead amidst appearances sometimes dubious vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and guaranty of the plans by which they were effected

profoundly penetrated with this idea i shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual that the free constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue that in fine the happiness of the people of these states under the auspices of liberty may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it

here perhaps i ought to stop but a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiments which are the result of much reflection of no inconsiderable observation and which appears to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people these will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel nor can i forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion

interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment

the unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now near to you it is justly so for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquillity at home your peace abroad of your safety of your prosperity of that very liberty which you so highly prize but as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts

for this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest citizens by birth or choice of a common country that country has a right to concentrate your affections the name of american which belongs to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations with slight shades of difference you have the same religion manners habits and political principles you have in a common cause fought and triumphed together the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers sufferings and successes

but these considerations however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole

the north in an unrestrained intercourse with the south protected by the equal laws of a common government finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry the south in the same intercourse benefiting by the same agency of the north sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand turning partly into its own channels the sea men of the north it finds its particular navigation invigorated and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted the east in a like intercourse with the west already finds and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home the west derives from the east supplies requisite to its growth and comfort and what is perhaps of still greater consequence it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight influence and the future maritime strength of the atlantic side of the union directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential advantage whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power must be intrinsically precarious

while then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength greater resource proportionably greater security from external danger a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations and what is of inestimable value they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce but which opposite foreign alliances attachments and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty in this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other

these considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere let experience solve it to listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal we are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions will afford a happy issue to the experiment it is well worth a fair and full experiment with such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands

in contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing the parties by geographical discriminations  northern and southern atlantic and western  whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views one of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts you cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection

the inhabitants of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head they have seen in the negotiation by the executive and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the treaty with spain and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the united states a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general government and in the atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in regard to the mississippi they have been witnesses to the formation of 2 treaties  that with great britain and that with spain  which secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers if such there are who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens

to the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable no alliances however strict between the parts can be an adequate substitute they must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced sensible of this momentous truth you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a constitution of government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns this government the offspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation completely free in its principles in the distribution of its powers uniting security with energy and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment has a just claim to your confidence and your support respect for its authority compliance with its laws acquiescence in its measures are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty

the basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government but the constitution which at any time exists ôtil changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government

all obstructions to the execution of the laws all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency they serve to organize faction to give it an artificial and extraordinary force to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties to make the public administration the mirror of the illconcerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests

however combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion

toward the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles however specious the pretexts one method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown in all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country the facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable liberty itself will find in such a government with powers properly distributed and adjusted its surest guardian it is indeed little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of persons and property

i have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally

this spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind it exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy

the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty

without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it

it serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration it agitates the community with illfounded jealousies and false alarms kindles the animosity of one part against another foments occasional riot and insurrection it opens the door to foreign influence and corruption which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another

there is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep live the spirit of liberty this within certain limits is probably true and in governments of monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party but in those of the popular character in governments purely elective it is a spirit not to be encouraged from their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it a fire not to be quenched it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warming it should consume

it is important likewise that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confirm themselves within their respective constitutional spheres avoiding the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position the necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power by dividing and distributing it into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern some of them in our country and under our own eyes to preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed the precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield

of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness  these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them a volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity let it simply be asked where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle

it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government the rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric promote then as an object of primary importance institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened

as a very important source of strength and security cherish public credit one method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shunning occasions of expense but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear

the execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate to facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue that to have revenue there must be taxes that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant that the intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in making it and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate

observe good faith and justice toward all nations cultivate peace and harmony with all religion and morality enjoin this conduct and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it it will be worthy of a free enlightened and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it can it be that providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue the experiment at least is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature alas! is it rendered possible by its vices

in the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated the nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave it is a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur

hence frequent collisions obstinate envenomed and bloody contests the nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy the government sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through passion what reason would reject at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives the peace often sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations has been the victim

so likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities of the other betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification it leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld and it gives to ambitious corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition corruption or infatuation

as avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot how many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions to practice the arts of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public councils! such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (i conjure you to believe me fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government but that jealousy to be useful must be impartial else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided instead of a defense against it excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests

the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible so far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith here let us stop

europe has a set of primary interests which to use have none or a very remote relation hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combination and collisions of her friendships or enmities

our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course if we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall counsel

why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice

it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world so far i mean as we are now at liberty to do it for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements i hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always the best policy i repeat therefore let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense but in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them

taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies

harmony liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy humanity and interest but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences consulting the natural course of things diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce but forcing nothing establishing with powers so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the rights of our merchants and to enable the government to support them conventional rules of intercourse the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation it is an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard

in offering to you my countrymen these counsels of an old and affectionate friend i dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression i could wish  that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations but if i may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit some occasional good  that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the impostures of pretended patriotism  this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated

how far in the discharge of my official duties i have been guided by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world to myself the assurance of my own conscience is that i have at least believed myself to be guided by them

in relation to the still subsisting war in europe my proclamation of [17930422] is the index to my plan sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of congress the spirit of that measure has continually governed me uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it

after deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights i could obtain i was well satisfied that our country under all the circumstances of the case had a right to take and was bound in duty and interest to take a neutral position having taken it i determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation perseverance and firmness

the considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail i will only observe that according to my understanding of the matter that right so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers has been virtually admitted by all

the duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without anything more from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation in cases in which it is free to act to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations

the inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience with me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its recent institutions and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it humanly speaking the command of its own fortunes

though in reviewing the incidents of my administration i am unconscious of intentional error i am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that i may have committed many errors whatever they may be i fervently beseech the almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend i shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence and that after 45 years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest

relying on its kindness in this as in other things and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations i anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which i promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government  the everfavorite object of my heart and the happy reward as i trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers

i embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself of congratulating you on the present favorable prospects of our public affairs the recent accession of the important state of north carolina to the constitution of the united states (of which official information has been received) the rising credit and respectability of our country the general and increasing good will toward the government of the union and the concord peace and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity

in resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious providence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present important session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism firmness and wisdom

among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of providing for the common defense will merit particular regard to be prepared for war is on e of the most effectual means of preserving peace

a free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined to which end a uniform and welldigested plan is requisite and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential particularly military supplies

the proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable will be entitled to mature consideration in the arrangements which may be made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy

there was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of indians would have relieved the inhabitants of our southern and western frontiers from their depredations but you will perceive from the information contained in the papers which i shall direct to be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the commonwealth of virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the union and if necessary to punish aggressors

the interests of the united states require that our intercourse with other nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to fulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive to the public good and to this end that the compensation to be made to the persons who may be employed should according to the nature of their appointments be defined by law and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the conduct of foreign affairs

various considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily ascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization

uniformity in the currency weights and measures of the united states is an object of great importance and will i am persuaded be duly attended to

the advancement of agriculture commerce and manufactures by all proper means will not i trust need recommendation but i can not forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a due attention to the postoffice and postroads

nor am i less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science and literature knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness in one in which the measures of government receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is proportionably essential

to the security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways  by convincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that every valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights to discern and provide against invasions of them to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness  cherishing the first avoiding the last  and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments with an inviolable respect to the laws

whether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to seminaries of learning already established by the institution of a national university or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the legislature

i saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the resolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the national honor and prosperity in this sentiment i entirely concur and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to devise such a provision as will be truly with the end i add an equal reliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the legislature

it would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the character and interests of the united states are so obviously so deeply concerned and which has received so explicit a sanction from your declaration

i have directed the proper officers to lay before you respectively such papers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended to your consideration and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the union which it is my duty to afford

the welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed and i shall derive great satisfaction from a cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our fellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free efficient and equal government

in meeting you again i feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public affairs the abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce

the progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of american stock abroad as well as at home and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated this latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit and let me add as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens the punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary

in conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 florins toward which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in holland as well the celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success the secretary of the treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information

since your last sessions i have received communications by which it appears that the district of kentucky at present a part of virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of the union in case the requisite sanction of congress be added for this sanction application is now made i shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid before you

the liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both the parties and the sentiments of warm attachment to the union and its present government expressed by our fellow citizens of kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted to you

it has been heretofore known to congress that frequent incursion have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of indians from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the united states renewed their violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect the lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity

these aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments as this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the president to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers and i have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient the event of the measure is yet unknown to me the secretary of war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended

the disturbed situation of europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the united states reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings it requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for a war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means and thereby at least enhance the price of transporting its valuable productions to their markets i recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to both of these great objects our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil

your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the mediterranean so many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it distressful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection

the laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons you will consider in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether an uniform process of execution on sentences issuing from the federal courts be not desirable through all the states

the patronage of our commerce of our merchants and sea men has called for the appointment of consuls in foreign countries it seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence the consular convention too with his most christian majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the national authority to his consuls established here some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect

the establishment of the militia of a mint of standards of weights and measures of the post office and post roads are subjects which i presume you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance
the sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt funded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself the appropriation you have made of the western land explains your dispositions on this subject and i am persuaded that the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with the other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be to every public interest as well as the more satisfactory to our constituents
in pursuing the various and weighty business of the present session i indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultation will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country in whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire it will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence
i meet you upon the present occasion with the feelings which are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situations of our common country and by a persuasion equally strong that the labors of the session which has just commenced will under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than patriotic issue in measures conducive to the stability and increase of national prosperity

numerous as are the providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the husbandman is too important to escape recollection

your own observations in your respective situations will have satisfied you of the progressive state of agriculture manufactures commerce and navigation in tracing their causes you will have remarked with particular pleasure the happy effects of that revival of confidence public as well as private to which the constitution and laws of the united states have so eminently contributed and you will have observed with no less interest new and decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the nation but you nevertheless can not fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances which will be disclosed in the several official communications that will be made to you in the course of your deliberations

the rapid subscriptions to the bank of the united states which completed the sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day is among the striking and pleasing evidences which present themselves not only of confidence in the government but of resource in the community

in the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and resolutions of the last session

among the most important of these is the defense and security of the western frontiers to accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish

accordingly at the same time the treaties have been provisionally concluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to confirm in their friendship the welldisposed tribes of indians effectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice

those measures having proved unsuccessful it became necessary to convince the refractory of the power of the united states to punish their depredations offensive operations have therefore been directed to be conducted however as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity

some of these have been crowned with full success and others are yet depending the expeditions which have been completed were carried on under the authority and at the expense of the united states by the militia of kentucky whose enterprise intrepidity and good conduct are entitled of peculiar commendation

overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes and considerable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further opposition removed from their former situations and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the united states

it is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may cease and that an intimate intercourse may succeed calculated to advance the happiness of the indians and to attach them firmly to the united states

in order to this it seems necessary 

that they should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensation of justice
that the mode of alienating their lands the main source of discontent and war should be so defined and regulated as to obviate imposition and as far as may be practicable controversy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are made
that commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment toward them and that such rational experiments should be made for imparting to them the blessings of civilization as may from time to time suit their condition
that the executive of the united states should be enabled to employ the means to which the indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation of peace
and that efficacious provision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who by violating their rights shall infringe the treaties and endanger the peace of the union
a system corresponding with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy toward an unenlightened race of men whose happiness materially depends on the conduct of the united states would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of sound policy

the powers specially vested in me by the act laying certain duties on distilled spirits which respect the subdivisions of the districts into surveys the appointment of officers and the assignment of compensations have likewise carried into effect in a manner in which both materials and experience were wanting to guide the calculation it will be readily conceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed by the law it is hoped that the circumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have secured that last two objects but it is probable that with a view to the first in some instances a revision of the provision will be found advisable

the impressions with which this law has been received by the community have been upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened and welldisposed citizens from the propriety and necessity of the measure the novelty however of the tax in a considerable part of the united states and a misconception of some of its provisions have given occasion in particular places to some degree of discontent but it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law and i entertain a full confidence that it will in all give way to motives which arise out of a just sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the public welfare

if there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with its main design may be so varied as to remove any wellintentioned objections that may happen to exist it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper variations it is desirable on all occasions to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary acts of government the fullest evidence of a disposition as far as may be practicable to consult the wishes of every part of the community and to lay the foundations of the public administration in the affections of the people

pursuant to the authority contained in the several acts on that subject a district of 10 miles square for the permanent seat of the government of the united state has been fixed and announced by proclamation which district will comprehend lands on both sides of the river potomac and the towns of alexandria and georgetown a city has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before congress and as there is a prospect favored by the rate of sales which have already taken place of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings there is every expectation of their due progress

the completion of the census of the inhabitants for which provision was made by law has been duly notified (excepting one instance in which the return has been informal and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and the returns of the officers who were charged with this duty which will be laid before you will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population of the united states borders on 4000000 persons

it is proper also to inform you that a further loan of 2500000 florins has been completed in holland the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced except as to a small reduction of charges another on like terms for 6000000 florins had been set on foot under circumstances that assured an immediate completion
in entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must anticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily incident to the first arrangements of a new government for an extensive country have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predecessors in cooperation with the other branch of the legislature the important objects which remain to be accomplished will i am persuaded be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive and equally well calculated of the advancement of the general weal

the time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the act making provision for the debt of the united states having expired statements from the proper department will as soon as possible apprise you of the exact result enough however is known already to afford an assurance that the views of that act have been substantially fulfilled the subscription in the domestic debt of the united states has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public creditors with the system which has been proposed to their acceptance and of the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the government with which they are actuated the subscriptions in the debts of the respective states as far as the provisions of the law have permitted may be said to be yet more general the part of the debt of the united states which remains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations

it is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the revenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their objects and may be permitted if no unforeseen exigency occurs to supersede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our constituents

an object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the current service of the ensuing year together with such ascertained demands upon the treasury as require to be immediately discharged and such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business for which no specific appropriation may have yet been made of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you
i shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed any definitive resolution their importance will recall them to your attention and i trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements of the government will afford you leisure to resume them to advantage

these are however some of them of which i can not forbear a more particular mention these are the militia the post office and post roads the mint weights and measures a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the united states

the first is certainly an object of primary importance whether viewed in reference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or to the preservation of order in connection with this the establishment of competent magazines and arsenals and the fortification of such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to consideration the safety of the united states under divine protection ought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances

the importance of the post office and post roads on a plan sufficiently liberal and comprehensive as they respect the expedition safety and facility of communication is increased by their instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government which while it contributes to the security of the people serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation and misconception the establishment of additional cross posts especially to some of the important points in the western and northern parts of the union can not fail to be of material utility

the disorders in the existing currency and especially the scarcity of small change a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a mint measures have been taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some of the most necessary artists together with the requisite apparatus

an uniformity in the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal must be no less honorable to the public councils than conducive to the public convenience

a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the united states is particularly urged among other reasons by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal and that being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right

it is some abatement of the satisfaction with which i meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally i am not able to add to it information that the indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our northwestern frontier have terminated

you will i am persuaded learn with no less concern than i communicate it that reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest an earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier to stop the further effusion of blood to arrest the progress of expense to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes in making which efforts i consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable or if not attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case

a detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will i trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed the issue of some of them indeed is still depending but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened

in the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service a sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace it will i presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality toward the families of the deceased

it must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it

a part of the cherokees known by the name of chickamaugas inhabiting five villages on the tennessee river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighboring settlements

it was hoped that the treaty of holston made with the cherokee nation in july 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations but the event has not answered this hope the chickamaugas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the united states in that quarter the information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed

it is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the united states or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter

i have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures a large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed a delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts a statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable

in looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable i derive consolation from the information i receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year this however will be better ascertained in the course of the session and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility

i can not dismiss the subject of indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the indians without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory to enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighborhood if in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable

the prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated this would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the united states these impediments have lessened and are lessening in local extent and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive

but symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters i judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto

measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders and congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws in fulfilling this trust i shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens

i can not forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system a representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced in the course of the execution of the laws considerations arise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy as connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the united states and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention

observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary it would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them i particularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishing just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them and in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session

in execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint others have been employed at home provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment there has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them

the regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will i doubt not be resumed and completed

it is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the post office operate in experiment against the transmission of news papers to distant parts of the country should this upon due inquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will i doubt not lead to the application of a remedy

the adoption of a constitution for the state of kentucky has been notified to me the legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order

it is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for 3000000 florins  one at antwerp at the annual interest of 45% with an allowance of 4% in lieu of all charges in the other 2 at amsterdam at the annual interest of 4% with an allowance of 55% in one case and of 5% in the other in lieu of all charges the rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad

among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced
i entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation

provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the bank of the united states pursuant to the eleventh section of the act by which it is incorporated in fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made

appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and i doubt not will engage your early attention
i content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you

various temporary laws will expire during the present session among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the indian tribes will merit particular notice

the results of your common deliberations hitherto will i trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to that constitution of government upon which under divine providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness

still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils
