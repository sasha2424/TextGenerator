Ladies and gentlemen family faculty and my fellow classmates of the class of 2010
before I begin I would like to thank those teachers who chose this modest speech among the
outstanding collection of speeches written by my highly competent peers I would also like to
thank all the people who have expressed their support for me and their anticipation for this
speech To be told You are the best person in the grade to give this speech or some variation
of that statement more than once is truly humbling and you all are either the most polite people
I know or the kindest people I know It is a great honor to give this address and I promise I do
not take it lightly I have chosen every word quite carefully because I am fully aware of the
responsibility you all have bestowed upon me
Today I stand before you as a personification of conflictedness I find myself on this
podium experiencing numerous warring emotions and I am certain many of you here empathize
with me on that point Firstly and perhaps most obviously I am filled with a great sense of
happiness and accomplishment My peers and I have put much effort for the last six years—a
third of our lives thus far—into being able to stand here today and say that we’ve earned the right
to stand here It was by no means easy and there were many times when I thought I would not
reach this finish line But those struggles have only made this moment sweeter The people who
are on this stage survived four years of Latin or 8th grade swim class or English with Ms
D’Amico or BC Calculus or the 25% rule and I think all of us can take some pride in that
Yet my ambivalence on this day stems from the very fact that this ceremony is the end of
an arduous journey While I am ready to continue my academic endeavors knowing that Hunter 
has thoroughly prepared me for them I am also filled with a deep sense of anxiety and sadness
Hunter has been my second home for the last six years and it has bordered on becoming my first
home Between my time diligently taking notes in the classroom playing Chinese Poker in the
hallway taking a nap in the GO office frantically rehearsing for a cultural show or theater
production in the auditorium cheering for an undefeated basketball team in the gymnasium or
simply sitting outside on the senior steps listening to a boom box and enjoying nice weather in
the courtyard Hunter has truly become a sanctuary for me My life has revolved around the fourstory
brick building that stands on East 94th Street and Park Avenue and Hunter’s intimate class
size means that I have become as connected to the people of this school as I have to the building
itself It may sound disingenuous to say that I will miss each and every one of you but all of you
in some small way have shaped me into the person I am today so I thank you all for that
Of course the comfort that I have attained at Hunter makes this departure a rather
anxious one but with anxiety comes excitement and the end of this journey signifies the start of
a brand new one As I leave behind the warmth that I have experienced at Hunter to enter a
vastly new and quite frightening terrain I can only help but think back to the last time I was in
this situation as a freshfaced wideeyed twelveyear old entering the foreboding windowless
Brick Prison for the first time Every aspect of my life since that point has been overwhelmingly
positive so all my fears about what lies ahead are slightly tamed by the idea that I will at least
come close to experiencing in my future what I have already experienced at Hunter
However ladies and gentlemen more than happiness relief fear or sadness I feel a very
strong emotion that I cannot ignore today More than anything else today I feel guilty
I feel guilty because I don’t deserve any of this And neither do any of you We received
an outstanding education at no charge based solely on our performance on a test we took when 
we were eleven year olds or four year olds We received superior teachers and additional
resources based on our status as gifted while kids who naturally needed those resources much
more than us wallowed in the mire of a broken system And now we stand on the precipice of
our lives in control of our lives based purely and simply on luck and circumstance If you truly
believe that the demographics of Hunter represent the distribution of intelligence in this city
then you must believe that the Upper West Side Bayside and Flushing are intrinsically more
intelligent than the South Bronx BedfordStuyvesant and Washington Heights and I refuse to
accept that It is certainly not Hunter’s fault that socioeconomic factors inhibit the educational
opportunities of some children from birth and in some ways I forgive colleges and universities
that are forced to review eighteen yearolds the end results of a broken system But we are
talking about eleven yearolds Four yearolds We are deciding children’s fates before they even
had a chance We are playing God and we are losing Kids are losing the opportunity to go to
college or obtain a career because no one taught them long division or colors Hunter is
perpetuating a system in which children who contain unbridled and untapped intellect and
creativity are discarded like refuse And we have the audacity to say they deserved it because
we’re smarter than them
As students we throw around empty platitudes like deserve and earn most likely
because it makes us feel better about ourselves However it simply isn’t the case I know for a
fact that I did not work as hard as I possibly could have and I think the same is true for everyone
on this stage Nevertheless people who work much harder than we ever could imagine will never
have the opportunities that lie in front of us
I apologize if this is not the speech you wanted to hear but you will have the rest of your
lives to celebrate your accomplishments I apologize if I have not inspired you or uplifted you 
but we have failed to inspire and uplift an entire generation of children That being said let me
make it very clear that I am not giving anyone here a moral lecture for I am as complicit in the
system we are a part of as anyone else in this room If anything I only make these remarks to
further emphasize how much Hunter has meant to me because I am acutely aware of where I
would be now without it As recipients of fortune we more than anyone else should be able to
understand and respect what our high school experience has meant to us and has done for us
My guilt ultimately stems from my awareness of the academic social emotional and
psychological tools that Hunter has blessed us with Therefore I believe the best way to assuage
this guilt is to use those fortuitous tools to not only better myself but also improve the society
that surrounds us outside these oh so narrow walls I do not know the capacity in which I will be
able to make this world a better and more just place but I strongly believe that education is the
most effective means of creating social improvement which is precisely why this is a battle we
cannot concede
My experiences at Hunter have left me with one final emotion; the last sentiment I will
share with you today is hope I hope that I will use the tools that Hunter has given me as a means
to provide opportunities to others not out of a sense of paternalistic philanthropy but out of a
sense of duty to give to other people what Hunter has given to me I also hope that you all will do
the same in whatever way you see fit Even more so I hope that in the near future education
itself will not be a privilege for the few in this world I hope that a quality education will not be a
privilege for the few in this country I hope that the Hunter community will descend from its
ivory tower made of brick and distribute its tools evenly to the mass of humanity that is the City
of New York I hope that despite its problems Hunter can prove to be the rule and not the
exception to what can exist as a school Finally I hope from the bottom of my heart that 
someday a class speaker can stand on this podium and look into an audience of his closest and
dearest friends whom he never would have met without Hunter and whom he’ll never forget an
audience of faculty members he has a deep respect and admiration for an audience of family
members who have supported him throughout his entire life without asking for anything in
return I hope this child can stand on this very stage look at the most important people in his life
and feel happy sad relieved scared accomplished or whatever his heart desires without feeling
guilty about a damn thing Thank you for your time
Congratulations graduates! Today is a great day It’s a day to celebrate with your
families and friends A day you’ve been waiting for since you entered kindergarten
those 13 long years ago
For some of you it’s waiting to get out of school and get on with your life It’s
a time when the old childhood rhyme No more pencils no more books no more
teachers’ dirty looks describes just how you feel
For many others of you high school graduation is just the next step in your
education You’re headed to a university a community college apprenticeship training
 to the daunting task of preparing for the career you want to pursue
But for all of you as you return the caps and gowns you’re wearing today and
take your tassels and diplomas home remember this The diploma you receive today is
your insurance policy with the premium paid in full by your hard work over the past 13
years The value of that policy depends on how much effort you put into your education
and what you do with it as you go on
Use it Take advantage of what it offers Statistics show that your high school
diploma is your passport to higher earnings and protection against tough economic
times It’s not a guarantee but it will always be a help
Your diploma also represents a public education system that insures that all
young people here in Sunnyvale and across our nation even the neediest
have access to the same experiences that have shaped you and me a first rate
education; an exposure to the diverse beliefs and traditions that drive an ever more
interdependent and complex world and a chance to experience the joy of learning
Take those experiences with you Keep close to the student and teacher friends
you’ve made here at Fremont High School And do well wherever you go and in
whatever you do
You’ve earned your passport Use it well Congratulations again to each of you
and may you all succeed in the years ahead
My fellow graduates and friends it is an honor to speak to all of you today Before I
go on I would like to put your minds’ at ease the answer is yes I am the cashier you
recognize from Stop and Shop Many people say that today is the day we start our journey
I disagree The journey began a long time ago Today just happens to be the day where the
path we have been traveling on splits into 275 unique roads Up until now we have been a
team walking as one We have done it all and we have done it together
Many of us have belonged to this school district since we started kindergarten
thirteen years ago and I want to take us all back to the date August 30th 2000 This was
the first day of school and the commencement of our journey Parents and grandparents
walked us to the bus stop where roughly a thousand pictures were taken Later that
afternoon Walgreens and CVSs across the town were developing pictures of our cute little
faces For six years after this first day of school we were blessed with recess the
halloween parade where students had the opportunity to show off their stunning costumes
Reading is Fun also known as RIF and the Scholastics Book Catalog where kids only
bought the books that came with incredible accessories Through it all elementary school
was the first the first step of our travels
We now stand at the merger of four roads becoming one four schools becoming one The
Middle School I think I can speak for everyone when I say these were probably the most
awkward three years of our lives With that said I will jump over this bump in the road and
as I do I would like to thank each teacher each principal and each person who took their
time to open the doors of this new chapter for those who were ready and held the hands of
those who weren’t
There are nine years behind us now on the road we travel and we have reached
another milestone in our journey When we walked into freshman orientation I am positive
each student had the same thought Woah! Those lockers are huge! And in the end we
really never used them This class of 2013 made history here We see it each day as we
walk down the halls You see the work of artists in our lobby You see the achievements in
sports posted on the record boards and in the local paper You hear musicians practicing
each morning And you see the academic achievements through the dedication and the
hard work of students in the classrooms Everyone should be proud of what they have
achieved These years have been nothing less than a success It was not easy though Just
look at this past year I honestly did not think we were going to graduate this year thanks to
Super Storm Sandy in October and a recordbreaking snow storm that made February
break last forever Now here we are We made it! High School was our guide to the
tradition to adulthood
So now the road we have been walking on brings us to today June 27th 2013 This
is the part of our journey where we stop for a moment to take a rest and to reflect on all that
has been accomplished What we have done together over the past few years is truly
wonderful We stuck together and grew together and I could not have chosen a better class
to be part of I have faith in each and every one of you that no matter which road each of
you choose to travel you will make it your own and you will succeed So my friends
remember to rest and relax and grow stronger let go and let God share your load Nothing
is lost or ended you’ve just come to a split in the road
Thank you
My fellow graduates
Today we see ourselves as we were four years ago young bright and new to the
halls of North Haven High School
We were unopened textbooks pencils not yet sharpened with hearts still raw and
unknowing as to what the coming years would hold The future is more real and honest and
pressing in this moment than it has seemed since that first year But if we have learned
anything it is that the future is unpredictable Life will continue to surprise us So today we
see ourselves as we can only hope to become
And that is scary …
I mean it’s terrifying
But for now we will relish this moment Because with such infinite possibilities
before us there are few things we know as sure as this
Today is June 27th 2013 and we are a class of young people who have grown
learned and made mistakes together We are generation in flux taking from the
heartbreak of recent history the courage to accept things we cannot change and to change
the things we can We may have grown according to different unique paths but I think we
would be surprised if we knew the ways we have impacted one another
We are a crowd of athletes musicians friends artists geniuses A crowd of
moments knowledge tears laughter and compassion A crowd of 285 students gathered
in one school and today the world lies unopened before us
So let us cherish this moment Let the enormity of it humble and elate us We will not
be sad We will not worry We will look forward and back at these faces that surround us
We don’t know who will have come into our lives a year from now Who will have left and
stayed And we don’t know where we will be So right now let us just be here
Completely undeniably here
It is hot The room is crowded And we may find our minds trailing to visions of the
future of the past But pretty soon this will be just another memory so let us not lose this
moment while it is still in our grasp
For now we sit united in this familiar territory As a class a community A sea of
heavy maroon fabric and eyes light with anticipation Let who we are in this moment define
us Not who we were yesterday or who we will be tomorrow but who we are right now
Greetings good afternoon and congratulations to my fellow peers
About a month ago a group of my classmates and I walked through the door of our
first block class at a time that was too early for us to be awake and ludicrously too early for
us to be showered dressed tooth brushed coffeeinfused and seated in a fluorescently lit
classroom While this AM class exhibited excellent student attendance its attending
students were noticeably absentminded and also appeared to be suffering from acute
symptoms of debilitating narcolepsy On this day during first block it was a struggle for us
just to lift our eyes past shut never mind engage in a usable retainable lesson In spite of
this quickly spreading bout of crippling endoftheyear senioritis our teacher persisted
However instead of the lesson she had planned she posed what seemed like an easily
answerable question She asked What is the true singular value of your high school
education?
After a long pause one cheerfully alert student raised his hand and when called
upon argued School makes us more knowledgeable This claim provoked the rousing of
even more students some shaking their heads in agreement and others noticeably
agitated Another student raised his hand and countered School prepares us for college
This led to the widening of even more eyes and a clamor of wellthat’strue’s and
butwhatif’s Another hand rose School helps us form career paths Another hand rose
School teaches us to be selfdisciplined Another hand rose School teaches us to be
responsible Another hand rose School helps us develop social skills Another hand
rose School teaches us the meaning of life Another hand rose School opens us up to
the world Another hand rose and another and another and another Our teacher calling
upon our rocketing hands resembled a strange rendition of the game WhacAMole Soon
however the frenzy became so fierce that handraising was abandoned altogether
Our once quiet docile class transformed into a circus of passionately screaming
teenagers There were myriad arguments made each transformed by the last The process
of discussing these arguments involved a great deal of quarreling hand waving nail biting
and I kid you not weeping It was a truly magnificent experience The presented arguments
managed to explain a number of pseudosubpurposes of our high school experience but
they ultimately failed to capture the one true value Truthfully it wasn’t even the subject
matter of this classroom discussion that made it such a momentous occurrence but rather
it was the fact that the class was arguing deliberating over a number of different
viewpoints It was through this fiery passionate deliberation that the true singular value of
our high school education became strikingly evident
While neither my classmates nor I realized it on that day in that classroom we were
displaying the very acquired skills that have made the expenditure of our last four years of
life worth it We were considering every available argument determining the positive and
negative aspects of each We were consciously choosing which argument to support We
were challenging our own beliefs and our own values We were being perceptive
deliberative and we were brandishing our accumulated knowledge in order to build a valid
persuasive case There exists a single word that sums up all of these reasoning abilities
control On that day in that classroom we were in complete and utter control of how we
were thinking and how we were making choices It is the acquisition of this control that
defines the true singular value of our high school education I urge you to continue using
the great the powerful the almighty skill that is control in all of your future endeavors for it
will allow you to live meaningfully and with purpose
I wish you luck and much much more Thank you
In this moment of pride for yourselves your friends your parents your beloved ones I bring to you a
message of humility
In a time of disintegration of broken down values of fragmented principles I dare to call your attention
to the holistic beauty of this moment
It was only twelve years ago when you crossed the gates of this or another school fearing the
forsaken solitude of the interminable hours between that grudgingly uttered good bye and the sight of
your mum or dad at the patio again at the end of the day
It was probably just seven years ago when home work began to build up as a chore to be performed
on a daily and grinding basis
Three years have passed since you felt that the peak of achievement waited for you in the High
School classrooms
And here you are today wondering what next
There is pride in your eyes there is hope in your hearts and there are plans for glory in your minds
Pride hope and glory are well deserved and you must savor the moment as the diver who jumps
from the highest cliff
However neither pride or hope or glory is a good strategy Being humble focused and not seeking the
credit will do a lot more to move you to the next level The thrill of the jump and the coolness of the
water are simple preludes to climbing the whole cliff back again reaching the new peak with sweat
and tears
In a world of interminable wars of terrorism-laden territories of famine amidst incomparable wealth
you have been privileged to be exposed to the greatest of all diversities That of cultures habits
languages attitudes and patterns of behavior Very few schools in the world can boast the enormous
diversity of nationalities to be found at ISB Moreover you are now a strong generation of
multinational and dare I say transnational individuals whose ability to cope with and celebrate
diversity is second to none
Tolerance and understanding are the most effective antidote to prejudice Like a parachute your mind
functions better because it is open Like an iPod you carry in your heads a baggage of sounds and
images that will shape the choices you will be making in the very near future
However nothing will replace your focus on your principles your values the ethical and moral ground
where all great ideas flourish Nothing will take away the need to look after your family your friends
your health Nothing will replace your need to be fair and just understanding and courageous in the
face of adversity
Courage my friends is not the absence of fear Only idiots have no fear Courage is the mastering of
it
Master your fear be humble aim higher live your dreams be fair and just remembering not solely
where you are going but particularly where you came from and one day you will look at the

education you received in this great school of ours as a foundation upon which you built the greatest
of all buildings The building of your character within the frame of your integrity
In the meantime savor the moment and as Mahatma Gandhi once said be the change you want to
see
